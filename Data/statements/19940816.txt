The Federal Reserve announced today the following monetary policy actions:

* The Board of Governors approved an increase in the discount rate from 3 1/2
  percent to 4 percent, effective immediately.

* The Federal Open Market Committee agreed that this increase would be allowed
  to show through completely into interest rates in reserve markets.

These measures were taken against the background of evidence of continuing
strength in the economic expansion and high levels of resource utilization. The
actions are intended to keep inflationary pressures contained, and thereby
foster sustainable economic growth.

The Federal Reserve will continue to monitor economic and financial
developments to gauge the appropriate stance of policy. But these actions are
expected to be sufficient, at least for a time, to meet the objective of
sustained, noninflationary growth.

In taking the discount rate action, the Board approved requests submitted by
the Boards of Directors of the Federal Reserve Banks of Boston, New York,
Richmond, Kansas City, and Dallas. The discount rate is the interest rate that
is charged depository institutions when they borrow from their district Federal
Reserve Banks.
