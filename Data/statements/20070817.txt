Financial market conditions have deteriorated, and tighter credit conditions
and increased uncertainty have the potential to restrain economic growth going

Committee is monitoring the situation and is prepared to act as needed to
mitigate the adverse effects on the economy arising from the disruptions in
financial markets.
