The Federal Open Market Committee decided today to ease the stance of monetary
policy slightly, expecting the federal funds rate to decline 1/4 percentage
point to around 5-1/4 percent.

The action was taken to cushion the effects on prospective economic growth in
the United States of increasing weakness in foreign economies and of less
accommodative financial conditions domestically. The recent changes in the
global economy and adjustments in U.S. financial markets mean that a slightly
lower federal funds rate should now be consistent with keeping inflation low
and sustaining economic growth going forward.

The discount rate remains unchanged at 5 percent.
