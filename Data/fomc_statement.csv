Date,Statement
1994-02-04,"Chairman Alan Greenspan announced today that the Federal Open Market Committeedecided to increase slightly the degree of pressure on reserve positions. Theaction is expected to be associated with a small increase in short-term moneymarket interest rates.The decision was taken to move toward a less accommodative stance in monetarypolicy in order to sustain and enhance the economic expansion.Chairman Greenspan decided to announce this action immediately so as to avoidany misunderstanding of the Committee's purposes, given the fact that this isthe first firming of reserve market conditions by the Committee since early1989."
1994-03-22,Chairman Alan Greenspan announced today that the Federal Open Market Committeedecided to increase slightly the degree of pressure on reserve positions. Thisaction is expected to be associated with a small increase in short-term moneymarket interest rates.
1994-05-17,"The Federal Reserve today announced two actions designed to maintain favorabletrends in inflation and thereby sustain the economic expansion.The Board approved an increase in the discount rate from 3 percent to 3-1/2percent, effective immediately, and the Federal Open Market Committee agreedthat this increase should be allowed to show through completely into interestrates in reserve markets.These actions, combined with the three adjustments initiated earlier this yearby the FOMC, substantially remove the degree of monetary accommodation whichprevailed throughout 1993. As always, the Federal Reserve will continue tomonitor economic and financial developments to judge the appropriate stance ofmonetary policy.In taking the discount action, the Board approved requests submitted by theBoards of Directors of eleven Federal Reserve Banks -- Boston, New York,Philadelphia, Richmond, Atlanta, Chicago, St. Louis, Minneapolis, Kansas City,Dallas and San Francisco. The discount rate is the interest rate that ischarged depository institutions when they borrow from their district FederalReserve Bank."
1994-08-16,"The Federal Reserve announced today the following monetary policy actions:* The Board of Governors approved an increase in the discount rate from 3 1/2  percent to 4 percent, effective immediately.* The Federal Open Market Committee agreed that this increase would be allowed  to show through completely into interest rates in reserve markets.These measures were taken against the background of evidence of continuingstrength in the economic expansion and high levels of resource utilization. Theactions are intended to keep inflationary pressures contained, and therebyfoster sustainable economic growth.The Federal Reserve will continue to monitor economic and financialdevelopments to gauge the appropriate stance of policy. But these actions areexpected to be sufficient, at least for a time, to meet the objective ofsustained, noninflationary growth.In taking the discount rate action, the Board approved requests submitted bythe Boards of Directors of the Federal Reserve Banks of Boston, New York,Richmond, Kansas City, and Dallas. The discount rate is the interest rate thatis charged depository institutions when they borrow from their district FederalReserve Banks."
1994-11-15,"The Federal Reserve Board today approved an increase in the discount rate from4 percent to 4 3/4 percent, effective immediately.In a related move, the Federal Open Market Committee decided that the increasein the discount rate should be reflected fully in interest rates in reservemarkets.These measures were taken against the background of evidence of persistentstrength in economic activity and high and rising levels of resourceutilization. In these circumstances, the Federal Reserve views these actions asnecessary to keep inflation contained, and thereby foster sustainable economicgrowth.In taking the discount rate action, the Board approved requests submitted bythe Boards of Directors of the Federal Reserve Banks of New York, St. Louis,and Kansas City. The discount rate is the interest rate that is chargeddepository institutions when they borrow from their district Federal Reservebanks."
1995-02-01,"The Federal Reserve Board today approved an increase in the discount rate from4 3/4 percent to 5 1/4 percent, effective immediately.In a related move, the Federal Open Market Committee agreed that this increaseshould be reflected fully in interest rates in the reserve markets.Despite tentative signs of some moderation in growth, economic activity hascontinued to advance at a substantial pace, while resource utilization hasrisen further. In these circumstances, the Federal Reserve views these actionsas necessary to keep inflation contained, and thereby foster sustainableeconomic growth.In taking the discount action, the Board approved requests submitted by theBoards of Directors of the Federal Reserve Banks of Boston, New York, Richmond,Chicago, St. Louis, Kansas City and San Francisco. The discount rate is theinterest rate that is charged depository institutions when they borrow fromtheir district Federal Reserve Banks."
1995-07-06,"Chairman Alan Greenspan announced today that the Federal Open Market Committeedecided to decrease slightly the degree of pressure on bank reserve positions.As a result of the monetary tightening initiated in early 1994, inflationarypressures have receded enough to accommodate a modest adjustment in monetaryconditions.Today's action will be reflected in a 25 basis point decline in the federalfunds rate from about 6 percent to about 5-3/4 percent."
1995-12-19,"Chairman Alan Greenspan announced today that the Federal Open Market Committeedecided to decrease slightly the degree of pressure on reserve positions.Since the last easing of monetary policy in July, inflation has been somewhatmore favorable than anticipated, and this result along with an associatedmoderation in inflation expectations warrants a modest easing in monetaryconditions.This action is expected to be reflected in a decline in the federal funds rateof 25 basis points, from about 5 3/4 percent to about 5 1/2 percent."
1996-01-31,"The Federal Reserve today announced the following policy actions:* The Board of Governors approved a reduction in the discount rate from 5-1/4percent to 5 percent, effective immediately.* In a related move, the Federal Open Market Committee agreed that thereduction would be reflected fully in interest rates in the reserve markets.This is expected to result in a reduction in the federal funds rate of 25 basispoints, from about 5-1/2 percent to about 5-1/4 percent.Moderating economic expansion in recent months has reduced potentialinflationary pressures going forward. With price and cost trends alreadysubdued, a slight easing of monetary policy is consistent with containedinflation and sustainable growth.In taking the discount action, the Board approved requests submitted by theBoards of Directors of the Federal Reserve Banks of New York, Philadelphia,Cleveland, Atlanta, Minneapolis, and Dallas."
1997-03-25,"The Federal Open Market Committee decided today to tighten money marketconditions slightly, expecting the federal funds rate to rise 1/4 percentagepoint to around 5-1/2 percent.This action was taken in light of persisting strength in demand, which isprogressively increasing the risk of inflationary imbalances developing in theeconomy that would eventually undermine the long expansion.In these circumstances, the slight firming of monetary conditions is viewed asa prudent step that affords greater assurance of prolonging the currenteconomic expansion by sustaining the existing low inflation environment throughthe rest of this year and next. The experience of the last several years hasreinforced the conviction that low inflation is essential to realizing theeconomy's fullest growth potential.No change was made in the Federal Reserve discount rate, which remains at 5percent."
1998-09-29,"The Federal Open Market Committee decided today to ease the stance of monetarypolicy slightly, expecting the federal funds rate to decline 1/4 percentagepoint to around 5-1/4 percent.The action was taken to cushion the effects on prospective economic growth inthe United States of increasing weakness in foreign economies and of lessaccommodative financial conditions domestically. The recent changes in theglobal economy and adjustments in U.S. financial markets mean that a slightlylower federal funds rate should now be consistent with keeping inflation lowand sustaining economic growth going forward.The discount rate remains unchanged at 5 percent."
1998-11-17,"The Federal Reserve today announced the following set of policy actions:* The Board of Governors approved a reduction in the discount rate by 25 basis  points from 4-3/4 percent to 4-1/2 percent.* The federal funds rate is expected to fall 25 basis points from around 5  percent to around 4-3/4 percent.Although conditions in financial markets have settled down materially sincemid-October, unusual strains remain. With the 75 basis point decline in thefederal funds rate since September, financial conditions can reasonably beexpected to be consistent with fostering sustained economic expansion whilekeeping inflationary pressures subdued.In taking the discount rate action, the Board approved requests submitted bythe Boards of Directors of the Federal Reserve Banks of New York, Philadelphia,and Dallas. The discount rate is the interest rate that is charged depositoryinstitutions when they borrow from their district Federal Reserve Banks."
1999-05-18,"The Federal Reserve released the following statement after today's Federal OpenMarket Committee meeting:While the FOMC did not take action today to alter the stance of monetarypolicy, the Committee was concerned about the potential for a buildup ofinflationary imbalances that could undermine the favorable performance of theeconomy and therefore adopted a directive that is tilted toward the possibilityof a firming in the stance of monetary policy. Trend increases in costs andcore prices have generally remained quite subdued. But domestic financialmarkets have recovered and foreign economic prospects have improved since theeasing of monetary policy last fall. Against the background of already-tightdomestic labor markets and ongoing strength in demand in excess of productivitygains, the Committee recognizes the need to be alert to developments overcoming months that might indicate that financial conditions may no longer beconsistent with containing inflation."
1999-06-30,"The Federal Open Market Committee today voted to raise its target for thefederal funds rate 25 basis points to 5 percent. Last fall the Committeereduced interest rates to counter a significant seizing-up of financial marketsin the United States. Since then much of the financial strain has eased,foreign economies have firmed, and economic activity in the United States hasmoved forward at a brisk pace. Accordingly, the full degree of adjustment isjudged no longer necessary.Labor markets have continued to tighten over recent quarters, but strengtheningproductivity growth has contained inflationary pressures.Owing to the uncertain resolution of the balance of conflicting forces in theeconomy going forward, the FOMC has chosen to adopt a directive that includesno predilection about near-term policy action. The Committee, nonetheless,recognizes that in the current dynamic environment it must be especially alertto the emergence, or potential emergence, of inflationary forces that couldundermine economic growth."
1999-08-24,"The Federal Open Market Committee today voted to raise its target for thefederal funds rate by 25 basis points to 5-1/4 percent. In a related action,the Board of Governors approved a 25 basis point increase in the discount rateto 4-3/4 percent.With financial markets functioning more normally, and with persistent strengthin domestic demand, foreign economies firming and labor markets remaining verytight, the degree of monetary ease required to address the global financialmarket turmoil of last fall is no longer consistent with sustained,noninflationary, economic expansion.Today's increase in the federal funds rate, together with the policy action inJune and the firming of conditions more generally in U.S. financial marketsover recent months, should markedly diminish the risk of rising inflation goingforward. As a consequence, the directive the Federal Open Market Committeeadopted is symmetrical with regard to the outlook for policy over the nearterm.In taking the discount rate action, the Federal Reserve Board approved requestssubmitted by the Boards of Directors of the Federal Reserve Banks of Boston,New York, Philadelphia, Cleveland, Richmond, Atlanta, Chicago, St. Louis,Kansas City, and San Francisco. The discount rate is the interest rate that ischarged depository institutions when they borrow from their district FederalReserve Banks."
1999-10-05,"The Federal Open Market Committee decided today to leave its target for thefederal funds rate unchanged.Strengthening productivity growth has been fostering favorable trends in unitcosts and prices, and much recent information suggests that these trends havebeen sustained.Nonetheless, the growth of demand has continued to outpace that of supply, asevidenced by a decreasing pool of available workers willing to take jobs. Inthese circumstances, the Federal Open Market Committee will need to beespecially alert in the months ahead to the potential for costs to increasesignificantly in excess of productivity in a manner that could contribute toinflation pressures and undermine the impressive performance of the economy.Against this background, the Committee adopted a directive that was biasedtoward a possible firming of policy going forward. Committee members emphasizedthat such a directive did not signify a commitment to near-term action. TheCommittee will need to evaluate additional information on the balance ofaggregate supply and demand and conditions in financial markets."
1999-11-16,"The Federal Open Market Committee today voted to raise its target for thefederal funds rate by 25 basis points to 5-1/2 percent. In a related action,the Board of Governors approved a 25 basis point increase in the discount rateto 5 percent.Although cost pressures appear generally contained, risks to sustainable growthpersist. Despite tentative evidence of a slowing in certain interest-sensitivesectors of the economy and of accelerating productivity, the expansion ofactivity continues in excess of the economy's growth potential. As aconsequence, the pool of available workers willing to take jobs has been drawndown further in recent months, a trend that must eventually be contained ifinflationary imbalances are to remain in check and economic expansion continue.Today's increase in the federal funds rate, together with the policy actions inJune and August and the firming of conditions more generally in U.S. financialmarkets over the course of the year, should markedly diminish the risk ofinflation going forward. As a consequence, the directive the Federal OpenMarket Committee adopted is symmetrical with regard to the outlook for policyover the near term.In taking the discount rate action, the Federal Reserve Board approved requestssubmitted by the Boards of Directors of the Federal Reserve Banks of Boston,Cleveland, Richmond and Kansas City. The discount rate is the rate chargeddepository institutions when they borrow short-term adjustment credit fromtheir district Federal Reserve Banks."
1999-12-21,"The Federal Open Market Committee made no change today in its target for thefederal funds rate.Based on the available evidence, however, the Committee remains concerned withthe possibility that over time increases in demand will continue to exceed thegrowth in potential supply, even after taking account of the remarkable rise inproductivity growth. Such trends could foster inflationary imbalances thatwould undermine the economy's exemplary performance.Nonetheless, in light of market uncertainties associated with the century datechange, the Committee decided to adopt a symmetric directive in order toindicate that the focus of policy in the intermeeting period must be ensuring asmooth transition into the Year 2000. At its next meeting the Committee willassess available information on the likely balance of supply and demand,conditions in financial markets, and the possible need for adjustment in thestance of policy to contain inflationary pressures."
2000-02-02,"The Federal Open Market Committee voted today to raise its target for thefederal funds rate by 25 basis points to 5-3/4 percent. In a related action,the Board of Governors approved a 25 basis point increase in the discount rateto 5-1/4 percent.The Committee remains concerned that over time increases in demand willcontinue to exceed the growth in potential supply, even after taking account ofthe pronounced rise in productivity growth. Such trends could fosterinflationary imbalances that would undermine the economy's record economicexpansion.Against the background of its long-run goals of price stability and sustainableeconomic growth and of the information currently available, the Committeebelieves the risks are weighted mainly toward conditions that may generateheightened inflation pressures in the foreseeable future.In taking the discount rate action, the Federal Reserve Board approved requestssubmitted by the Boards of Directors of the Federal Reserve Banks of Boston,New York, Philadelphia, Cleveland, Richmond, Atlanta, Chicago, St. Louis,Kansas City and San Francisco. The discount rate is the rate charged depositoryinstitutions when they borrow short-term adjustment credit from their districtFederal Reserve Banks."
2000-03-21,"The Federal Open Market Committee voted today to raise its target for thefederal funds rate by 25 basis points to 6 percent. In a related action, theBoard of Governors approved a 25 basis point increase in the discount rate to5-1/2 percent.Economic conditions and considerations addressed by the Committee areessentially the same as when the Committee met in February. The Committeeremains concerned that increases in demand will continue to exceed the growthin potential supply, which could foster inflationary imbalances that wouldundermine the economy's record economic expansion.Against the background of its long-run goals of price stability and sustainableeconomic growth and of the information currently available, the Committeebelieves the risks are weighted mainly toward conditions that may generateheightened inflation pressures in the foreseeable future.In taking the discount rate action, the Federal Reserve Board approved requestssubmitted by the Boards of Directors of the Federal Reserve Banks of Boston,New York, Philadelphia, Cleveland, Richmond, Atlanta, Chicago, St. Louis,Minneapolis, Kansas City and San Francisco. The discount rate is the ratecharged depository institutions when they borrow short-term adjustment creditfrom their district Federal Reserve Banks."
2000-05-16,"The Federal Open Market Committee voted today to raise its target for thefederal funds rate by 50 basis points to 6-1/2 percent. In a related action,the Board of Governors approved a 50 basis point increase in the discount rateto 6 percent.Increases in demand have remained in excess of even the rapid pace ofproductivity-driven gains in potential supply, exerting continued pressure onresources. The Committee is concerned that this disparity in the growth ofdemand and potential supply will continue, which could foster inflationaryimbalances that would undermine the economy's outstanding performance.Against the background of its long-term goals of price stability andsustainable economic growth and of the information already available, theCommittee believes the risks are weighted mainly toward conditions that maygenerate heightened inflation pressures in the foreseeable future.In taking the discount rate action, the Federal Reserve Board approved requestssubmitted by the Boards of Directors of the Federal Reserve Banks of Boston,Cleveland, Richmond, and San Francisco. The discount rate is the rate chargeddepository institutions when they borrow short-term adjustment credit fromtheir district Federal Reserve Banks."
2000-06-28,"The Federal Open Market Committee at its meeting today decided to maintain theexisting stance of monetary policy, keeping its target for the federal fundsrate at 6-1/2 percent.Recent data suggest that the expansion of aggregate demand may be moderatingtoward a pace closer to the rate of growth of the economy's potential toproduce. Although core measures of prices are rising slightly faster than ayear ago, continuing rapid advances in productivity have been containing costsand holding down underlying price pressures.Nonetheless, signs that growth in demand is moving to a sustainable pace arestill tentative and preliminary, and the utilization of the pool of availableworkers remains at an unusually high level.In these circumstances, and against the background of its long-term goals ofprice stability and sustainable economic growth and of the informationcurrently available, the Committee believes the risks continue to be weightedmainly toward conditions that may generate heightened inflation pressures inthe foreseeable future."
2000-08-22,"The Federal Open Market Committee at its meeting today decided to maintain theexisting stance of monetary policy, keeping its target for the federal fundsrate at 6-1/2 percent.Recent data have indicated that the expansion of aggregate demand is moderatingtoward a pace closer to the rate of growth of the economy's potential toproduce. The data also have indicated that more rapid advances in productivityhave been raising that potential growth rate as well as containing costs andholding down underlying price pressures.Nonetheless, the Committee remains concerned about the risk of a continuing gapbetween the growth of demand and potential supply at a time when theutilization of the pool of available workers remains at an unusually highlevel.Against the background of its long-term goals of price stability andsustainable economic growth and of the information currently available, theCommittee believes the risks continue to be weighted mainly toward conditionsthat may generate heightened inflation pressures in the foreseeable future."
2000-10-03,"The Federal Open Market Committee at its meeting today decided to maintain theexisting stance of monetary policy, keeping its target for the federal fundsrate at 6-1/2 percent.Recent data have indicated that the expansion of aggregate demand has moderatedto a pace closer to the enhanced rate of growth of the economy's potential toproduce. The more rapid advances in productivity also continue to help containcosts and hold down underlying price pressures.However, the utilization of the pool of available workers remains at anunusually high level. Moreover, the increase in energy prices, though havinglimited effect on core measures of prices to date, poses a risk of raisinginflation expectations. The subdued behavior of those expectations so far hascontributed importantly to maintaining an environment conducive to maximumsustainable growth.Against the background of its long-term goals of price stability andsustainable economic growth and of the information currently available, theCommittee believes the risks continue to be weighted mainly toward conditionsthat may generate heightened inflation pressures in the future."
2000-11-15,"The Federal Open Market Committee at its meeting today decided to maintain theexisting stance of monetary policy, keeping its target for the federal fundsrate at 6-1/2 percent.The utilization of the pool of available workers remains at an unusually highlevel, and the increase in energy prices, though having limited effect on coremeasures of prices to date, still harbors the possibility of raising inflationexpectations. The Committee, accordingly, continues to see a risk of heightenedinflation pressures. However, softening in business and household demand andtightening conditions in financial markets over recent months suggest that theeconomy could expand for a time at a pace below the productivity-enhanced rateof growth of its potential to produce.Nonetheless, to date the easing of demand pressures has not been sufficient towarrant a change in the Committee's judgment that against the background of itslong-run goals of price stability and sustainable economic growth and of theinformation currently available, the risks continue to be weighted mainlytoward conditions that may generate heightened inflation pressures in theforeseeable future."
2000-12-19,"The Federal Open Market Committee at its meeting today decided to maintain theexisting stance of monetary policy, keeping its target for the federal fundsrate at 6-1/2 percent.The drag on demand and profits from rising energy costs, as well as erodingconsumer confidence, reports of substantial shortfalls in sales and earnings,and stress in some segments of the financial markets suggest that economicgrowth may be slowing further. While some inflation risks persist, they arediminished by the more moderate pace of economic activity and by the absence ofany indication that longer-term inflation expectations have increased. TheCommittee will continue to monitor closely the evolving economic situation.Against the background of its long-run goals of price stability and sustainableeconomic growth and of the information currently available, the Committeeconsequently believes that the risks are weighted mainly toward conditions thatmay generate economic weakness in the foreseeable future."
2001-01-03,"The Federal Open Market Committee decided today to lower its target for thefederal funds rate by 50 basis points to 6 percent.In a related action, the Board of Governors approved a 25-basis-point decreasein the discount rate to 5-3/4 percent, the level requested by seven ReserveBanks. The Board also indicated that it stands ready to approve a furtherreduction of 25 basis points in the discount rate to 5-1/2 percent on therequests of Federal Reserve Banks.These actions were taken in light of further weakening of sales and production,and in the context of lower consumer confidence, tight conditions in somesegments of financial markets, and high energy prices sapping household andbusiness purchasing power. Moreover, inflation pressures remain contained.Nonetheless, to date there is little evidence to suggest that longer-termadvances in technology and associated gains in productivity are abating.The Committee continues to believe that, against the background of its long-rungoals of price stability and sustainable economic growth and of the informationcurrently available, the risks are weighted mainly toward conditions that maygenerate economic weakness in the foreseeable future.In taking the discount rate action, the Federal Reserve Board approved requestssubmitted by the Boards of Directors of the Federal Reserve Banks of New York,Cleveland, Atlanta, St. Louis, Kansas City, Dallas and San Francisco."
2001-01-31,"The Federal Open Market Committee at its meeting today decided to lower itstarget for the federal funds rate by 50 basis points to 5-1/2 percent. In arelated action, the Board of Governors approved a 50 basis point reduction inthe discount rate to 5 percent.Consumer and business confidence has eroded further, exacerbated by risingenergy costs that continue to drain consumer purchasing power and press onbusiness profit margins. Partly as a consequence, retail sales and businessspending on capital equipment have weakened appreciably. In response,manufacturing production has been cut back sharply, with new technologiesappearing to have accelerated the response of production and demand topotential excesses in the stock of inventories and capital equipment.Taken together, and with inflation contained, these circumstances have calledfor a rapid and forceful response of monetary policy. The longer-term advancesin technology and accompanying gains in productivity, however, exhibit fewsigns of abating and these gains, along with the lower interest rates, shouldsupport growth of the economy over time.Nonetheless, the Committee continues to believe that against the background ofits long-run goals of price stability and sustainable economic growth and ofthe information currently available, the risks are weighted mainly towardconditions that may generate economic weakness in the foreseeable future.In taking the discount rate action, the Federal Reserve Board approved requestssubmitted by the Boards of Directors of the Federal Reserve Banks of New York,Philadelphia, Cleveland, Atlanta, Chicago, St. Louis, Minneapolis, Dallas andSan Francisco."
2001-03-20,"The Federal Open Market Committee at its meeting today decided to lower itstarget for the federal funds rate by 50 basis points to 5 percent. In a relatedaction, the Board of Governors approved a 50 basis point reduction in thediscount rate to 4-1/2 percent.Persistent pressures on profit margins are restraining investment spending and,through declines in equity wealth, consumption. The associated backup ininventories has induced a rapid response in manufacturing output and, withspending having firmed a bit since last year, inventory adjustment appears tobe well underway.Although current developments do not appear to have materially diminished theprospects for long-term growth in productivity, excess productive capacity hasemerged recently. The possibility that this excess could continue for some timeand the potential for weakness in global economic conditions suggestsubstantial risks that demand and production could remain soft. In thesecircumstances, when the economic situation could be evolving rapidly, theFederal Reserve will need to monitor developments closely.The Committee continues to believe that against the background of its long-rungoals of price stability and sustainable economic growth and of the informationcurrently available, the risks are weighted mainly toward conditions that maygenerate economic weakness in the foreseeable future.In taking the discount rate action, the Federal Reserve Board approved requestssubmitted by the Boards of Directors of all twelve Reserve Banks."

In a related action,the Board of Governors approved a 50 basis point reduction in the discount rateto 4 percent.The FOMC has reviewed prospects for the economy in light of the informationthat has become available since its March meeting. A significant reduction inexcess inventories seems well advanced. Consumption and housing expenditureshave held up reasonably well, though activity in these areas has flattenedrecently. Although measured productivity probably weakened in the firstquarter, the impressive underlying rate of increase that developed in recentyears appears to be largely intact.Nonetheless, capital investment has continued to soften and the persistenterosion in current and expected profitability, in combination with risinguncertainty about the business outlook, seems poised to dampen capital spendinggoing forward. This potential restraint, together with the possible effects ofearlier reductions in equity wealth on consumption and the risk of slowergrowth abroad, threatens to keep the pace of economic activity unacceptablyweak. As a consequence, the Committee agreed that an adjustment in the stanceof policy is warranted during this extended intermeeting period.The Committee continues to believe that against the background of its long-rungoals of price stability and sustainable economic growth and of the informationcurrently available, the risks are weighted mainly toward conditions that maygenerate economic weakness in the foreseeable future.In taking the discount rate action, the Federal Reserve Board approved requestssubmitted by the Boards of Directors of the Federal Reserve Banks of Boston,New York, Philadelphia, Cleveland, Atlanta, Minneapolis, Dallas, and SanFrancisco."

Consumptionand housing expenditures have held up reasonably well, though activity in theseareas has flattened recently. Investment in capital equipment, however, hascontinued to decline. The erosion in current and prospective profitability, incombination with considerable uncertainty about the business outlook, seemslikely to hold down capital spending going forward. This potential restraint,together with the possible effects of earlier reductions in equity wealth onconsumption and the risk of slower growth abroad, continues to weigh on theeconomy.With pressures on labor and product markets easing, inflation is expected toremain contained. Although measured productivity growth stalled in the firstquarter, the impressive underlying rate of increase that developed in recentyears appears to be largely intact, supporting longer-term prospects.The Committee continues to believe that against the background of its long-rungoals of price stability and sustainable economic growth and of the informationcurrently available, the risks are weighted mainly toward conditions that maygenerate economic weakness in the foreseeable future.In taking the discount rate action, the Federal Reserve Board approved requestssubmitted by the Boards of Directors of the Federal Reserve Banks of New York,Richmond, Chicago, St. Louis and San Francisco."

2008-03-11,"Since the coordinated actions taken in December 2007, the G-10 central banks have continued to work together closely and to consult regularly on liquidity pressures in funding markets. Pressures in some of these markets have recently increased again. We all continue to work together and will take appropriate steps to address those liquidity pressures.  To that end, today the Bank of Canada, the Bank of England, the European Central Bank, the Federal Reserve, and the Swiss National Bank are announcing specific measures.Federal Reserve ActionsThe Federal Reserve announced today an expansion of its securities lending program.  Under this new Term Securities Lending Facility (TSLF), the Federal Reserve will lend up to $200 billion of Treasury securities to primary dealers secured for a term of 28 days (rather than overnight, as in the existing program) by a pledge of other securities, including federal agency debt, federal agency residential-mortgage-backed securities (MBS), and non-agency AAA/Aaa-rated private-label residential MBS.  The TSLF is intended to promote liquidity in the financing markets for Treasury and other collateral and thus to foster the functioning of financial markets more generally.  As is the case with the current securities lending program, securities will be made available through an auction process.  Auctions will be held on a weekly basis, beginning on March 27, 2008.  The Federal Reserve will consult with primary dealers on technical design features of the TSLF.In addition, the Federal Open Market Committee has authorized increases in its existing temporary reciprocal currency arrangements (swap lines) with the European Central Bank (ECB) and the Swiss National Bank (SNB).  These arrangements will now provide dollars in amounts of up to $30 billion and $6 billion to the ECB and the SNB, respectively, representing increases of $10 billion and $2 billion.  The FOMC extended the term of these swap lines through September 30, 2008.The actions announced today supplement the measures announced by the Federal Reserve on Friday to boost the size of the Term Auction Facility to $100 billion and to undertake a series of term repurchase transactions that will cumulate to $100 billion.Information on Related Actions Being Taken by Other Central BanksInformation on the actions that will be taken by other central banks is available at the following websites* [Bank of Canada](http://www.bank-banque-canada.ca/en/notices_fmd/2008/not110308.html)* [Bank of England](http://www.bankofengland.co.uk/publications/news/2008/017.htm)* [European Central Bank](http://www.ecb.int/press/pr/date/2008/html/pr080311.en.html)* [Swiss National Bank (61 KB PDF)](http://www.snb.ch/en/mmr/reference/pre_20080311/source/pre_20080311.en.pdf)Statements by Other Central Banks* [Bank of Japan](http://www.boj.or.jp/en/type/release/adhoc/un0803a.htm)* [Sveriges Riksbank](http://www.riksbank.com/templates/Page.aspx?id=27564)"

2009-12-16,"Information received since the Federal Open Market Committee met in Novembersuggests that economic activity has continued to pick up and that thedeterioration in the labor market is abating. The housing sector has shown somesigns of improvement over recent months. Household spending appears to beexpanding at a moderate rate, though it remains constrained by a weak labormarket, modest income growth, lower housing wealth, and tight credit.Businesses are still cutting back on fixed investment, though at a slower pace,and remain reluctant to add to payrolls; they continue to make progress inbringing inventory stocks into better alignment with sales. Financial marketconditions have become more supportive of economic growth. Although economicactivity is likely to remain weak for a time, the Committee anticipates thatpolicy actions to stabilize financial markets and institutions, fiscal andmonetary stimulus, and market forces will contribute to a strengthening ofeconomic growth and a gradual return to higher levels of resource utilizationin a context of price stability.With substantial resource slack likely to continue to dampen cost pressures andwith longer-term inflation expectations stable, the Committee expects thatinflation will remain subdued for some time.The Committee will maintain the target range for the federal funds rate at 0 to1/4 percent and continues to anticipate that economic conditions, including lowrates of resource utilization, subdued inflation trends, and stable inflationexpectations, are likely to warrant exceptionally low levels of the federalfunds rate for an extended period. To provide support to mortgage lending andhousing markets and to improve overall conditions in private credit markets,the Federal Reserve is in the process of purchasing $1.25 trillion of agencymortgage-backed securities and about $175 billion of agency debt. In order topromote a smooth transition in markets, the Committee is gradually slowing thepace of these purchases, and it anticipates that these transactions will beexecuted by the end of the first quarter of 2010. The Committee will continueto evaluate the timing and overall amounts of its purchases of securities inlight of the evolving economic outlook and conditions in financial markets.In light of ongoing improvements in the functioning of financial markets, theCommittee and the Board of Governors anticipate that most of the FederalReserve’s special liquidity facilities will expire on February 1, 2010,consistent with the Federal Reserve’s announcement of June 25, 2009. Thesefacilities include the Asset-Backed Commercial Paper Money Market Mutual FundLiquidity Facility, the Commercial Paper Funding Facility, the Primary DealerCredit Facility, and the Term Securities Lending Facility. The Federal Reservewill also be working with its central bank counterparties to close itstemporary liquidity swap arrangements by February 1. The Federal Reserveexpects that amounts provided under the Term Auction Facility will continue tobe scaled back in early 2010. The anticipated expiration dates for the TermAsset-Backed Securities Loan Facility remain set at June 30, 2010, for loansbacked by new-issue commercial mortgage-backed securities and March 31, 2010,for loans backed by all other types of collateral.

Indicators suggest a deterioration in overalllabor market conditions in recent months, and the unemployment rate has movedup.  Household spending has flattened out, investment in nonresidentialstructures is still weak, and the housing sector remains depressed.  However,business investment in equipment and software continues to expand.  Temporaryfactors, including the damping effect of higher food and energy prices onconsumer purchasing power and spending as well as supply chain disruptionsassociated with the tragic events in Japan, appear to account for only some ofthe recent weakness in economic activity.  Inflation picked up earlier in theyear, mainly reflecting higher prices for some commodities and imported goods,as well as the supply chain disruptions.  More recently, inflation hasmoderated as prices of energy and some commodities have declined from theirearlier peaks.  Longer-term inflation expectations have remained stable.Consistent with its statutory mandate, the Committee seeks to foster maximumemployment and price stability.  The Committee now expects a somewhat slowerpace of recovery over coming quarters than it did at the time of the previousmeeting and anticipates that the unemployment rate will decline only graduallytoward levels that the Committee judges to be consistent with its dual mandate.Moreover, downside risks to the economic outlook have increased.

2013-01-30,"Information received since the Federal Open Market Committee met in Decembersuggests that growth in economic activity paused in recent months, in largepart because of weather-related disruptions and other transitory factors.Employment has continued to expand at a moderate pace but the unemployment rateremains elevated. Household spending and business fixed investment advanced,and the housing sector has shown further improvement. Inflation has beenrunning somewhat below the Committee’s longer-run objective, apart fromtemporary variations that largely reflect fluctuations in energy prices.Longer-term inflation expectations have remained stable.Consistent with its statutory mandate, the Committee seeks to foster maximumemployment and price stability. The Committee expects that, with appropriatepolicy accommodation, economic growth will proceed at a moderate pace and theunemployment rate will gradually decline toward levels the Committee judgesconsistent with its dual mandate.  Although strains in global financial marketshave eased somewhat, the Committee continues to see downside risks to theeconomic outlook. The Committee also anticipates that inflation over the mediumterm likely will run at or below its 2 percent objective.To support a stronger economic recovery and to help ensure that inflation, overtime, is at the rate most consistent with its dual mandate, the Committee willcontinue purchasing additional agency mortgage-backed securities at a pace of$40 billion per month and longer-term Treasury securities at a pace of $45billion per month. The Committee is maintaining its existing policy ofreinvesting principal payments from its holdings of agency debt and agencymortgage-backed securities in agency mortgage-backed securities and of rollingover maturing Treasury securities at auction. Taken together, these actionsshould maintain downward pressure on  longer-term interest rates, supportmortgage markets, and help to make broader financial conditions moreaccommodative.The Committee will closely monitor incoming information on economic andfinancial developments in coming months. If the outlook for the labor marketdoes not improve substantially, the Committee will continue its purchases ofTreasury and agency mortgage-backed securities, and employ its other policytools as appropriate, until such improvement is achieved in a context of pricestability. In determining the size, pace, and composition of its assetpurchases, the Committee will, as always, take appropriate account of thelikely efficacy and costs of such purchases.To support continued progress toward maximum employment and price stability,the Committee expects that a highly accommodative stance of monetary policywill remain appropriate for a considerable time after the asset purchaseprogram ends and the economic recovery strengthens. In particular, theCommittee decided to keep the target range for the federal funds rate at 0 to1/4 percent and currently anticipates that this exceptionally low range for thefederal funds rate will be appropriate at least as long as the unemploymentrate remains above 6-1/2 percent, inflation between one and two years ahead isprojected to be no more than a half percentage point above the Committee’s 2percent longer-run goal, and longer-term inflation expectations continue to bewell anchored. In determining how long to maintain a highly accommodativestance of monetary policy, the Committee will also consider other information,including additional measures of labor market conditions, indicators ofinflation pressures and inflation expectations, and readings on financialdevelopments. When the Committee decides to begin to remove policyaccommodation, it will take a balanced approach consistent with its longer-rungoals of maximum employment and inflation of 2 percent.Voting for the FOMC monetary policy action were: Ben S.

In lightof the cumulative progress toward maximum employment and the improvement in theoutlook for labor market conditions, the Committee decided to modestly reducethe pace of its asset purchases. Beginning in January, the Committee will addto its holdings of agency mortgage-backed securities at a pace of $35 billionper month rather than $40 billion per month, and will add to its holdings oflonger-term Treasury securities at a pace of $40 billion per month rather than$45 billion per month. The Committee is maintaining its existing policy ofreinvesting principal payments from its holdings of agency debt and agencymortgage-backed securities in agency mortgage-backed securities and of rollingover maturing Treasury securities at auction.

In determining how long to maintaina highly accommodative stance of monetary policy, the Committee will alsoconsider other information, including additional measures of labor marketconditions, indicators of inflation pressures and inflation expectations, andreadings on financial developments. The Committee now anticipates, based on itsassessment of these factors, that it likely will be appropriate to maintain thecurrent target range for the federal funds rate well past the time that theunemployment rate declines below 6-1/2 percent, especially if projectedinflation continues to run below the Committee's 2 percent longer-run goal.When the Committee decides to begin to remove policy accommodation, it willtake a balanced approach consistent with its longer-run goals of maximumemployment and inflation of 2 percent.Voting for the FOMC monetary policy action were: Ben S.

The Committee's sizable and still-increasingholdings of longer-term securities should maintain downward pressure onlonger-term interest rates, support mortgage markets, and help to make broaderfinancial conditions more accommodative, which in turn should promote astronger economic recovery and help to ensure that inflation, over time, is atthe rate most consistent with the Committee's dual mandate.The Committee will closely monitor incoming information on economic andfinancial developments in coming months and will continue its purchases ofTreasury and agency mortgage-backed securities, and employ its other  policytools as appropriate, until the outlook for the labor market has improvedsubstantially in a context of price stability. If incoming information broadlysupports the Committee's expectation of ongoing improvement in labor marketconditions and inflation moving back toward its longer-run objective, theCommittee will likely reduce the pace of asset purchases in further measuredsteps at future meetings. However, asset purchases are not on a preset course,and the Committee's decisions about their pace will remain contingent on theCommittee's outlook for the labor market and inflation as well as itsassessment of the likely efficacy and costs of such purchases.To support continued progress toward maximum employment and price stability,the Committee today reaffirmed its view that a highly accommodative stance ofmonetary policy will remain appropriate for a considerable time after the assetpurchase program ends and the economic recovery strengthens. The Committee alsoreaffirmed its expectation that the current exceptionally low target range forthe federal funds rate of 0 to 1/4 percent will be appropriate at least as longas the unemployment rate remains above 6-1/2 percent, inflation between one andtwo years ahead is projected to be no more than a half percentage point abovethe Committee's 2 percent longer-run goal, and longer-term inflationexpectations continue to be well anchored. In determining how long to maintaina highly accommodative stance of monetary policy, the Committee will alsoconsider other information, including additional measures of labor marketconditions, indicators of inflation pressures and inflation expectations, andreadings on financial developments. The Committee continues to anticipate,based on its assessment of these factors, that it likely will be appropriate tomaintain the current target range for the federal funds rate well past the timethat the unemployment rate declines below 6-1/2 percent, especially ifprojected inflation continues to run below the Committee's 2 percent longer-rungoal.

Inflation on a 12-month basis is expected to remain somewhat below 2 percent in the near term but to stabilize around the Committee's 2 percent objective over the medium term. Near-term risks to the economic outlook appear roughly balanced, but the Committee is monitoring inflation developments closely.In view of realized and expected labor market conditions and inflation, the Committee decided to maintain the target range for the federal funds rate at 1 to 1-1/4 percent. The stance of monetary policy remains accommodative, thereby supporting some further strengthening in labor market conditions and a sustained return to 2 percent inflation.In determining the timing and size of future adjustments to the target range for the federal funds rate, the Committee will assess realized and expected economic conditions relative to its objectives of maximum employment and 2 percent inflation. This assessment will take into account a wide range of information, including measures of labor market conditions, indicators of inflation pressures and inflation expectations, and readings on financial and international developments. The Committee will carefully monitor actual and expected inflation developments relative to its symmetric inflation goal. The Committee expects that economic conditions will evolve in a manner that will warrant gradual increases in the federal funds rate; the federal funds rate is likely to remain, for some time, below levels that are expected to prevail in the longer run. However, the actual path of the federal funds rate will depend on the economic outlook as informed by incoming data.The balance sheet normalization program initiated in October 2017 is proceeding."
