# Assignment 4: Recurrent Neural Network Language Model

## Due: March 11, 11:59p Pacific

This assignment consists of two notebooks and a number of py files.  Files you should pay special attention to:

* **Start here:** [rnnlm-instructions.ipynb](rnnlm-instructions.ipynb) (Instructions: do not edit.)
* [rnnlm-workbook.ipynb](rnnlm-workbook.ipynb) (Answer notebook: your work goes here.)
* [rnnlm.py](rnnlm.py) (LM implementation, and most of your code.)

**Warning:** This assignment is the longest of the course and cannot be completed comfortably in the weekend before it's due.  Plan accordingly!

## Piazza

Due to the high volume of questions this semester (particularly right before due-dates), the instructors will be giving priority to _public_ questions on Piazza. We'll be sure to answer everything, but private posts may receive a slower response time. As a reminder:

- For **conceptual questions:** ask in a public post. _(Note that you can post anonymously if you wish.)_
- For **questions with code or answers:** consider if you can remove the code/answers and make your question public.

Optimal "get help" algorithm:

1. **Re-read the instructions.** (Pay special attention to the _hints_ and `# code comments`.)
2. Check the assignment thread/FAQ on Piazza for common questions and errata.
3. Search for the error message you get from Python / TensorFlow.
4. Check Piazza to see if someone else asked the same question.

If you can't find an answer, post on Piazza or come to OH and we'll do our best to help you!


## Other resources

This assignment builds on the demo notebook for Week 5, so you may want to review that before you start. (**Hint:** borrow ideas and code!)

* [nplm.ipynb](../../materials/nplm/nplm.ipynb)

As always, you should commit your changes often with `git add` and `git commit`.

## Submission instructions

Please submit by running the submit script:
```
./assignment/submit.sh -u your-github-username -a 4
```
You can view your work in your usual submission repo on the `a4-submit` branch.
